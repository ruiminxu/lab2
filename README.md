To complete this project, I used quicksort, for loop, Scanner, Filewritter, and 2D array.

First, I need call a scanner to read in the csv file. To split them up, I called the split method.
By using a for loop, i get the splited array and put it into 2d array. After it is filled up, I created 
more arrays to file the artist name only. Then, I use quicksort to put it into a ABC order. Then after it is 
sorted, I created a method where I count how many times the names popped up and put it into an int array.
Then, I created another method where I remove the duplicates and put that into a String array.
Finally, they are both parrell array which can be put into a 2D array. But, the int array must be converted into
a string array. Finally, use filewriter to create a text file of the 2D array info.
